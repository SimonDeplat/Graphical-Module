# Graphical Module (GM)

#### Overview

The Graphical Module (GM) is a Quark (an extension) that adds a collection of widgets to the SuperCollider (SC) language.

You can find previews, and discuss this project, on [the SuperCollider forum](https://scsynth.org/t/new-quark-graphicalmodule-gm-a-new-collection-of-widgets/9591).

GM extends SuperCollider (SC) graphic capacities with a collection of ~20 widgets of all kinds. Every class is fully documented and illustrated with examples, highly customizable, and all classes are tied together with a centralized palette system.

Being a recent project, **the Graphical Module is still consider in BETA**.

#### What's inside?

- **ready to use buttons**: checkboxes, button grids, recording, visual feedback, ...
- **GMCurveEnvView**: a widget that allows to shape and bend enveloppes
- **GMKeyboard**: a piano keyboard emulation that can be controlled from a MIDI device
- a **sequencer interface** that eases the manipulation of rythmic patterns
- **GMListPianoRoll**: an easy to use piano roll
- **GMStyle**: a palette system that modifies several widgets at once
- **svg support** on most relevant classes
- every class is **fully documented and illustrated with examples** within SCs built-in documentation
- integrated value mapping
- and **more**...

#### Installation

Do not forget to update your Quark repository!

Evaluating `Quarks.install("GraphicalModule");` should do the trick.

Otherwise, you can use ScIDE and select `Language > Quarks` to install it.

In both cases, you will need to recompile the class library after the first installation.

#### Getting started

GM comes along with two in-depth guides that cover all the Quark utilisation basics:

- FM Drone Example

- Sequencer interface example

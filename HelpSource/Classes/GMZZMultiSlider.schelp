description::

link::Classes/GMZZMultiSlider:: is an abstract class that defines multiple values sliders behavior within the scope of the Graphical Module. The class name begins with "GMZZ" so it is displayed last in the autocompletion API.

subsection::A note about this documentation

This class is an extension of the link::Classes/GMZZSlider:: class. It retains the same principle, but for several values instead of one. As such, you should read the link::Classes/GMZZSlider:: class documentation first, as only differences between those two classes are documented here.

subsection::Action Mode

link::Classes/GMZZMultiSlider:: manipulates an link::Classes/Array:: of values. The size of this array will define how many sliders are displayed within the view. By default, the link::Classes/Function:: associated with the code::action:: will be called passing this array as argument every time one of the value is modified.

This is however somehow inefficient, as the the multislider only allows
to modify a single value at a time. You can change this behavior by setting the code::actionMode:: parameter to code::\index::. In this case, the function will be evaluated with the index of the value, and its new value, as arguments :

code::
(
GMMultiFaderSlider()
.actionMode_(\index)
.action_({ |index, newValue|
	"Value at index ".post;
	index.post;
	" was changed to ".post;
	newValue.postln;
})
.front
)
::

subsection::Orientation

The orientation logic isn't the same as link::Classes/GMZZSlider::. Here, an code::\horizontal:: orientation means sliders will be distributed horizontally, which means they will be interacted with vertically.

When the sliders are distributed vertically, the topmost slider will modify the first value of the array, the bottommost slider will modify the last value of the array.

subsection::Sequencer API

link::Classes/GMZZMultiSlider:: can be used as a sequencer. As such, it is possible to highlight certain sliders, and to use a link::Classes/Routine:: to highlight the current beat. Since those are graphical properties only, those methods are documented within the documentation of the classes that inherit from link::Classes/GMZZMultiSlider::.

classmethods::

method:: new
Creates a new instance of link::Classes/GMZZMultiSlider::.

returns:: a link::Classes/GMZZMultiSlider:: instance. This method is implicitely internal.

instancemethods::

method:: values
Sets or gets the values the multislider is manipulating. The size of the array defines how many sliders are displayed.

method:: action
Sets or gets the link::Classes/Function:: to be evaluated when interacting with the multislider changes one its value. Depending on the selected code::actionMode::, this link::Classes/Function:: either takes the current values as argument, or the last modified value with its index.

method:: actionMode
Sets or gets the argument format the code::action:: function is expecting. Can be either code::\values:: or code::\index:: (see above).

method:: orientation
Sets or gets the orientation of the multislider. This refers to the orientation of the sliders distribution, not the orientation they are interacted with. Can be either code::\horizontal:: or code::\vertical::.

EXAMPLES::

code::
(
s.waitForBoot({
	var win = Window.new(
		"",
		Rect(0, 400, 200, 100)
	);

	var button;

	SynthDef(\GMhelp, {
		|out = 0, amp = 0.1, freq = 440|
		var snd = SinOsc.ar(freq, mul: amp);
		snd = snd * EnvGen.kr(Env.perc);
		Out.ar(0, snd!2);
	}).add;

	// Instanciate the View, and assign a string
	button = GMButton();
	button.string_("beep");

	// Assign custom actions
	button.mouseDownAction_(
		{ Synth(\GMhelp, [\freq, 300]) });
	button.mouseUpAction_(
		{ Synth(\GMhelp, [\freq, 450]) });

	// Nest it inside a Layout
	win.layout_(
		HLayout(
			button,
	).margins_(0));

	win.front;

	// Useful when developping

DESCRIPTION::
link::Classes/GMTextView:: is a link::Classes/View:: that displays text.

It only allows for centered text. You can specify the text orientation. It will automatically resize when its container is resized.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
Creates a new instance of link::Classes/GMTextView::.

Its graphical properties are defined by its associated link::Classes/GMStyle::. By default, its borders are hidden. Use code::.displayBorder_(true):: to modify this property.

returns:: a link::Classes/GMTextView:: instance.

INSTANCEMETHODS::

METHOD:: string
Sets or gets the displayed text, and refreshes the link::Classes/View::.

METHOD:: orientation
Sets or gets the displayed text orientation, and refreshes the link::Classes/View::. Valid values are : code::\right::, code::\top::, code::\left:: or code::\bottom::.

METHOD:: fontRatio
Sets or gets the widget displayed text ratio, relative to the smallest axis of the widget, and refreshes the link::Classes/View::. You'll need to reduce this value if the displayed text is larger than the size of the widget.

Please note that this modifies the font ratio itsel, not the ratio of the displayed string. As such, you might want to divide this value if you are displaying multiple text lines.

METHOD:: maxFontSize
Sets or gets the widget maximum font height, expressed in pixels.

subsection::Internal Methods

METHOD:: draw
The function associated to the link::Classes/View::'s code::drawFunc::. Shouldn't be modified.

EXAMPLES::

code::
(
var win = Window.new(
	"",
	Rect(0, 400, 300, 100)
);
var label = GMTextView()
.fontRatio_(0.4)
.string_("Hello World !");

// Nest it inside a Layout
win.layout_(
	HLayout(
		label,
).margins_(0));

win.front;

// Useful when developping
CmdPeriod.doOnce({ win.close; });
)
::

You can use code::.displayFrame_(true):: to render the link::Classes/GMStyle:: frame :

code::
(
var label = GMTextView()
.fontRatio_(0.15)
.displayFrame_(true)
.string_("Hello World !")
.front;
)

subsection::Interaction

method:: action
Sets or gets the link::Classes/Function:: to be triggered when the button is pressed down. This link::Classes/Function:: takes the current state of the button as a boolean as argument, i.e. pressing it down once will call the link::Classes/Function:: passing code::true:: as argument, pressing it down a second time will call the link::Classes/Function:: passing code::false:: as argument, etc.

argument:: aFunction
A Function with one argument, the state of the button as a link::Classes/Boolean::.

method:: mouseDownAction
Sets or gets the link::Classes/Function:: to be triggered when the button is pressed down. This link::Classes/Function:: takes the current state of the button as a boolean as argument, i.e. pressing it down once will call the link::Classes/Function:: passing code::true:: as argument, pressing it down a second time will call the link::Classes/Function:: passing code::false:: as argument, etc. Equivalent to code::.action:: .

argument:: aFunction
A link::Classes/Function:: with one argument, the state of the button as a link::Classes/Boolean::.

method:: toggle
Toggles the button, changing its state and evaluating the associated action.

method:: toggleDisplay
